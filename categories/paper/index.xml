1. What is a Scientific Paper ? A paper is an organized description of hypotheses, date and conclusions, intended to instruct the reader. Papers are a central part of research . If you research does not generate papers, it might just as well not have been done. &amp;ldquo;Interesting and unpublished&amp;rdquo; is equivalent to &amp;ldquo;non-existent&amp;rdquo;.
Realize that your objective in research is to formulate and test hypotheses, to draw conclusions from these tests, and to teach these conclusions to others.</description>
